Things to do:

* Does the code properly match shots to waveforms?
* 99.99 must be the value for no bottom detect
* caf splitter... pull apart a caf into one file per cbf
* create a database from caf/cbf's
  - Index into the binary file so accessing the waveforms is easy
* cab to kml
  - line mode.  Break into cbf sections
  - thumbtack / placemark mode
  - stacked waveform mode
* be able to dump specific waveforms into other forms
  - matlab m file
  - python file with plotting code


Description:

The CARIS Lidar format is fundamentaly broken.  The wave form does not
appear to have units and mixes the signals from each of the lasers.  After
writing a decoder for this format, I suggest you avoid using this format
if at all possible.

Lidar data comes as two files.  A CAF ascii file containing shot
header information.  The CBF binary file contains one waveform per shot.
